Fourier Transform Exploration
=============================
Mention the phrase "Fourier analysis," and most peoples' eyes will glaze over. However, I'm convinced that Fourier analysis is really interesting stuff! Unfortunately, the math involved can be a bit overwhelming, but that's why I think it is important to teach the concepts of Fourier analysis/transforms without getting bogged down in the calculations. Given the right context and examples, most people can understand the underlying concepts.

The Goal
--------
This project aims to use the HTML 5 canvas to explore Fourier analysis and transforms.

When I was in college, I found a variety of websites that collectively helped me to understand these concepts. A couple that helped the most were Java applets that provided visuals of waveforms that I could manipulate in real-time. I would like to build a similar project, but combine several different types of examples in one web app. And why use Java applets when we could use the new and exciting HTML 5 canvas?

It's definitely a work in progress, but you can see the beginning of a demo [here](http://ceedubs.github.com/fourier-transform-exploration/)
